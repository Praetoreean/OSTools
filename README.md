2)  Visit the OpenSimWorld region on the Metropolis Grid: secondlife://hypergrid.org:8002:OpenSimWorld/128/128/22 to get  a (free, of course) copy of the opensimworld.com gate object. 

3) Rez this object in your region, and click on it. You will be asked to paste the region key that you copied in step 1.

That's all! Your region will now appear in opensimworld.com with live-updating statistics. 


If you keep having trouble , just use the add the beacon script from this repository to a prim object.
